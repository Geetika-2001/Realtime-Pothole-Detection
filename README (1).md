A Realtime Pothole Detection Mechanism to avoid loss of lives due to Potholes in roads.
The idea is to divide the Problem in different uses cases and create custom navigation program according to the client requirement.

With Vehicle information gaining high importance within the domain of automotive  technologies  there are considerable efforts in developing systems & solutions for a holistic human machine interface (HMI), through our approach of the Pothole detection Mechanism.

For enhancing rider safety, comfort and user  experience weâ€™ve built a system using Machine Learning CNN Algorithm, and Kaggle Notebook, and dataset for Code implementation. 


## Algorithm Description

[Documentation](https://linktodocumentation)

A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning system that can take
an input image, assign relevance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image, and distinguish between them. When compared to other classification methods,
the amount of pre-processing required by a ConvNet is significantly less.
A ConvNet is able to successfully capture the Spatial and Temporal dependencies in an image 
through the application of relevant filters. The architecture performs a better fitting to the image dataset due to the reduction in the number of parameters involved and reusability of weights
